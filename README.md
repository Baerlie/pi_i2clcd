# pi_i2clcd

This code is based on Lewis Loflin's code:
https://www.bristolwatch.com/rpi/i2clcd.htm

Adaptions I made:
- using pigpio (http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html) instead of wiringPi
- added two more lines for 20x04 LCDs

Instructions to install pigpio: http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html

Running this demo:
- download the code
- run make
- run sudo ./i2clcd
